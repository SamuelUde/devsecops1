Which of the following Jenkins plugins can we use for creating a pipeline job?
Pipeline
Which of the following are examples of CI tools ?
Jenkins, TravisCI, Teamcity

Configure a Jenkins pipeline job called devsecops-numeric-application to build this project and to run some tests. Refer the requirements below:

Create a Jenkins pipeline job called devsecops-numeric-application. This job should run the pipeline from kubernetes-devops-security repository's Jenkinsfile.
Update the Jenkinsfile in the kubernetes-devops-security repository to add a stage, which should build the artifacts using maven. The command you would need to run is mvn clean package -DskipTests=true, also remember to save the artifcats (jar files) so that we can download it later.
Remember to install all required Jenkins plugins which might be needed for this pipeline.

Before hitting the Check button, please make sure that you have already tested your pipeline and that it is working as expected.
CheckCompleteIncomplete
Installed required plugins?
Created a pipeline job called "devsecops-numeric-application"?
Build Artifact stage is working fine?

From the Jenkins UI install the below mentioned plugins:


Pipeline
Git


Now, create a pipeline job called devsecops-numeric-application.

Further from the vscode update the Jenkinsfile as below and push the changes to the origin:


pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build Artifact - Maven') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"
        archive 'target/*.jar'
      }
    }
  }
}

Modify the pipeline that was created in the previous step and add another stage for running unit tests using maven.
In this same stage add a post field to utilise Jacoco to generate and visualise the tests report in Jenkins.

Before submitting the task please make sure you have already tested your pipeline and it is working fine.

Unit tests are working fine?

Jacoco reports are working fine?
From the Jenkins UI install the below mentioned plugins:
Jacoco
JUnit


From the vscode update the Jenkinsfile as below and push the changes to the origin:
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build Artifact - Maven') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn clean package -DskipTests=true"
        archive 'target/*.jar'
      }
    }
    stage('Unit Tests - JUnit and Jacoco') {
      steps {
        sh "mvn test"
      }
      post {
        always {
          junit 'target/surefire-reports/*.xml'
          jacoco execPattern: 'target/jacoco.exec'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

Let us now configure a webhook on the Gitea server for the kubernetes-devops-security repository so that any push we make to this repository triggers the Jenkins job automatically.


Create the required webhook in Gitea for kubernetes-devops-security repository and make the necessary changes in devsecops-numeric-application pipeline job as well.

CheckCompleteIncomplete
Installed required plugins?

Configured the git webhook and integrated the same within Jenkins?

From the Jenkins UI install the below plugin:


Gitea


Create a webhook in Gitea as per steps given below:

Login into the Gitea server using the given credentials.
Go to the kubernetes-devops-security repository.
Click on Settings then Webhooks
Click on Add Webhook and select Gitea option.
In the Target URL box enter the Jenkins URL like this https://8091-port-b5f9272e1c2c4b00.kk-lab-dev.kodekloud.com/gitea-webhook/post (remember to replace this URL with the original URL)
Leave the other options as it is and click on Add Webhook


Now login into Jenkins and follow below given steps:

Click on Manage Jenkins and then Configure System
Look for Gitea Servers option and click on Add->Gitea Server
Under Gitea Server Name enter any name like Gitea
Under Server URL enter the Gitea server URL like https://8092-port-aa1fa1f8b8d9420e.kk-lab-dev.kodekloud.com (remember to replace the URL with the original URL)
Finally click on Save
Go to the devsecops-numeric-application job configuration and enable Poll SCM option in pipeline job and save.
